This repository contains KML maps of terrestrial fibre-optic cable projects in Africa.  The purpose of this repository is to serve as source for the AfTerFibre map.  After a fibre map in image format has been traced in Google Earth, the KML for the trace is exported to a unique filename based on the name of the operator.  KML maps are then uploaded to this repository.  The AfTerFibre map extracts data directly from this repository and converts it into GeoJSON format for rendering with Google Maps.  You can find out more about the project at http://manypossibilities.net/afterfibre and you can see the emerging map at http://afterfibre.net
