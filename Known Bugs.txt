Known Bugs:
- Probes not used for particular IP measurements still display on map

Data:
- 12 IP addresses not reached at all haven't been removed from data

Interactions Nice to Have (But haven’t been implemented):
- Mouseover polyline highlights route
- Clicking polyline selects that route
- Mousing over destination IPs brings icon forward
- Animation for each traceroute related to latency speed:
	1. For a single route
	2. On a per hop basis

Representation Nice to Have (But haven’t been implemented): 
- Dashed lines for incomplete traceroutes

HTML:
- Have heading bar for clicked destination IP info (instead of having to mouseover)

Future (future) Work:
- Display results for different protocols (ICMP, UDP, TCP)
- Compare protocols for a single probe to a single destination (Four tiled map views or all on same map)
